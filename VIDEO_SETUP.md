# Video Setup Instructions

## Required Video Files

To make the VideoCarousel work, you need to add the following video files to the `/public/videos/` directory:

1. `highlight-first.mp4` (4 seconds duration)
2. `highlight-sec.mp4` (5 seconds duration)
3. `highlight-third.mp4` (2 seconds duration)
4. `highlight-fourth.mp4` (3.63 seconds duration)

Place your video files in: `/home/vishwas/jubilant-enigma/public/videos/`

## Hero Section Image

The Hero component is currently configured to use:
- `/public/shoes/shoe-10.avif`

Make sure this image exists in your public/shoes directory (which it does based on your workspace structure).

## Icons

The following SVG icons have been created for video controls:
- `/public/icons/play.svg`
- `/public/icons/pause.svg`
- `/public/icons/replay.svg`

These are placeholder icons and can be replaced with custom designs if needed.
